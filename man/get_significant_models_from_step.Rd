\usage{
get_significant_models_from_step(
  search_state,
  step_number,
  p_value,
  rse_threshold = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{search_state}{List containing search state}

\item{step_number}{Integer. Step number to check}

\item{p_value}{Numeric. P-value for significance testing (e.g., 0.05 for forward, 0.01 for backward)}

\item{rse_threshold}{Numeric. RSE threshold for significance}
}
\value{
Character vector of significant model names
}
\description{
Returns model names from a step that have ΔOFV above threshold.
Threshold is calculated per model based on covariate degrees of freedom.
