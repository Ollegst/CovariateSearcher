\arguments{
\item{search_state}{List containing covariate search state and configuration}

\item{base_model_id}{Character. Starting base model name (default: "run1")}

\item{scm_type}{Character. Type of SCM algorithm to use:
\itemize{
\item "standard" - Traditional SCM testing all covariates each step
\item "selective" - Selective SCM testing only significant model covariates
}}

\item{starting_phase}{Character. Which phase to start with:
\itemize{
\item "forward" - Start with forward selection (SCM)
\item "backward" - Start with backward elimination (SCM+)
}}

\item{full_scm}{Logical. Whether to run complete SCM workflow.
If TRUE: Always runs Forward selection â†’ Backward elimination (regardless of starting_phase)
If FALSE: Runs only the specified starting_phase
Note: True SCM should always include both forward and backward phases (default: TRUE)}

\item{forward_ofv_threshold}{Numeric. OFV improvement threshold for forward selection.
If NULL, uses search_state$search_config$forward_ofv_threshold (default: 3.84)}

\item{backward_ofv_threshold}{Numeric. OFV threshold for backward elimination.
If NULL, uses 6.63 (more stringent than forward). Only used when starting_phase = "backward".}

\item{rse_threshold}{Numeric. Maximum RSE threshold as percentage.
If NULL, uses search_state$search_config$max_rse_threshold (default: 50)}

\item{max_wait_minutes}{Numeric. Maximum wait time per step in minutes (default: 120)}

\item{auto_submit}{Logical. Whether to automatically submit models to cluster (default: TRUE)}

\item{auto_retry}{Logical. Whether to enable automatic retry for failed models (default: TRUE)}

\item{save_checkpoints}{Logical. Whether to save state after each major step (default: TRUE)}

\item{checkpoint_prefix}{Character. Prefix for checkpoint filenames (default: "scm_auto")}

\item{final_testing}{Logical. Whether to test excluded covariates on final model (default: TRUE)}

\description{
Runs complete end-to-end SCM testing starting from base model through
forward selection and final model validation. Includes automatic retry, error
recovery, progress monitoring, and comprehensive reporting. Designed for hands-off
execution with intelligent decision making.
